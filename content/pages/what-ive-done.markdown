# History (2010 - 2016)
This experiment in keyboard-bashing that is programming officially started six years ago when I was 14. (*unofficially I dabbled in C for game development when I was 12, but that didn't go anywhere*) My first years were spent learning to write bad C from a used copy of "Sams Teach Yourself C in 21 days" that I got from the [Edward McKay](http://www.edmckay.com/) in Winston-Salem, NC. After many Hello World esque programs, a teeny tiny web server that I used to learn how to create network sockets, a Pong clone with C/SDL, and many failed **planning-stage** game projects I eventually graduated to higher-level programming, markup, DDL, and stylesheet languages like Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, and other small bits of tech that I can't really claim to *know* well enough to list here.

Along the way I picked up a bit of experience with various flavors of GNU/Linux, and FOSS in general. Over the years I've dual-booted and more recently virtualized Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Slackware, and Arch Linux. Additionally, as a result I've picked up some experience running and configuring various services like web servers, VoIP servers (Mumble, specifically), and other things. Essentially, I'm fairly experienced in picking through documentation and using it to configure something, preferably doing so in a manner that tries to follow best practices.

I also built a [Linux from Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) system once. *Never again.*

I began attending Wytheville Community College in the Summer of 2014, and graduated *summa cum laude* with an **Associates of Applied Sciences (A.A.S.) in Information Technology** (*with a networking specialization*) in the Spring of 2016. The main thing I took away from the course program was a more in-depth knowledge of the network protocol stack, IP addressing, subnets, DNS, etc. Other material the courses covered includes rudimentary HTML5, C#, Java, verbal communication skills (*speeches*), configuring Cisco switches and routers, and written communication.

# Present (2016 - ????)
At present I am employed at [PRONETS](http://www.pronetsweb.com) in Galax, VA. My responsibilities here include Linux server administration and updates, Wordpress updates and development, creating CSS to implement designs, communicating with clients in regards to quotes for new development on existing sites, and working on support tickets submitted by web clients. My official title is "Senior Web Developer."

When I'm not working, or coding I enjoy playing, and listening to music. I've got some guitar covers up on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZachuoriceRich), and have some original noodlings on my [Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/machnik1000/).

My OG hobby was video games, and I still very much enjoy them. I've been playing the new DOOM, the remake of Resident Evil 0, and the old Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness lately. If you love old point-and-click games, or just have an old title in mind that you'd love to play again, check out the amazing [GOG (Good Old Games).](http://www.gog.com)
