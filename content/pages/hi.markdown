Summary: Welcome, I am a programmer, amateur musician, college graduate, and many many more labels. However I don't really know what I am.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is me:

<div class="me"><img src="{filename}/images/me.jpg" style="width: auto;" /></div>

My full name is *Zachary Richey*, I really don't care if you call me Zach, Zachary, or Dave, so long as you don't spell my name "Zack." I also go by *zachuorice* online in various places.

I'm currently Senior Web Developer at <a href="http://pronetsweb.com" target="_blank">PRONETS</a>. Which basically means PHP, CSS, Wordpress, and server administration. And, that's all I'm going to say about that.

Feel free to look around, there isn't much here yet. I hope to write about code, my experiences, music, music transcription, and probably more.
