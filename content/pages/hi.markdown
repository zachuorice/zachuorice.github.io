Summary: Welcome, I am a programmer, amateur musician, college graduate, and many many more labels. However I don't really know what I am.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is me:

My full name is *Zachary Richey*, I really don't care if you call me Zach, Zachary, or Dave, so long as you don't spell my name "Zack." I also go by *zachuorice* online in various places.

I'm currently Senior Web Developer at [PRONETS](http://pronetsweb.com). Which basically means PHP, CSS, Wordpress, and server administration. But you're not here for that, no, you're here for interesting, fulfilling, life-changing, incredible, AMAZING content!... -*Well that's not going to happen*- but perhaps you'll find something of interest on my site.

Feel free to look around, there isn't much here yet. I hope to write about code, my experiences, music, music transcription, and probably more.
